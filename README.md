# Natural-Language-Processing

A collection of personal notebooks, learning resourcing scraped from various sources (cited appropriately) for learning introductory to intermediate level for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python and R programming. Also includes course material from Coursera specialisation in NLP.

1.  [**SONA - Neural Networks and NLP**]{.underline}

Application of text mining and neural networks to create an artificial (feed-forward) neural network to predict the president of South Africa given a sentence of text taken from State of the Nations Address's. 

I.e,. Built a neural network that, given a sentence of text, predicts which president was the source of that sentence. We compare performance of neural network to that of many benchmark algorithms. 

Key Features: Sentiment Analysis, NLP, Bag-of-words, TFIDF, Neural Networks, Text Cleaning, Imbalanced Data, Classification, Machine Learning, GBM, Random Forest.
